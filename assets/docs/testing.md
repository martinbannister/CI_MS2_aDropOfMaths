Links to the inial report and the final result with no errors are in the table below.

### CSS Validation
I used the [W3C CSS Validation Service](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) to validate my style.css file of the site.

The CSS passed first time with [zero errors](assets/docs/images/testing/css_validator_styles.png).
