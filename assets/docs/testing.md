### CSS Validation
I used the [W3C CSS Validation Service](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) to validate my style.css file of the site.

The CSS passed first time with [zero errors](docs/validation/css/W3C_CSS_Validation.png).

I used the [WAVE WebAIM web accessibility evaluation tool]() to check that there we no issues with accessibility standards.  

All pages pass without errors except for about.html.
