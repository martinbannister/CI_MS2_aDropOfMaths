## Scope


## Design


### Colour Scheme
I have chosen the ability to select from two colour schemes for the game.  One is a more somber less garish colour pallet targeted at adults.  The other is a more bright a colourful pallet that should appeal more to children.  

The reason for this is that I wanted the game to be accessibly to people of all ages; a game parents could let their children play to improve their maths skills and a game that adults can play to improve their day to day mental arithmatic. 

Just having the one child-like colour pallet could put off adult players.

### Typography
I chose the short stack font for it's readable quality and because it reflects characters that are rendered in a more hand written way than traditional typography.  This should make it more readable and accessible for children.

Both fonts are served from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
