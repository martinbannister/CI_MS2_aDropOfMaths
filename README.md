# A Drop of Maths
[A Drop of Maths](https://martinbannister.github.io/CI_MS2_aDropOfMaths/) is a mathematical game for people of all ages to enjoy and improve or maintain their mental arithmetic skills.  

The game has been designed to be both fun and challenging whatever your still level and game settings can be customised to change the level of difficulty.  There is even a choice of game theme for children or adults.  The theme for children is more bright and colourful and the theme for adults is largely monochromatic based on variations of the same blue colour.  The theme is purely cosmetic as the game settings determine the difficulty.

If you would like to have a go yourself and challenege your mental artihmetic skills **_A Drop of Maths_** can be found at [https://martinbannister.github.io/CI_MS2_aDropOfMaths/](https://martinbannister.github.io/CI_MS2_aDropOfMaths/).

## User Experience
---
The author designed the site so that the game can be played on a veriety of devices and screeen sizes.  The author's goal was to create a game that was both fun and educational and could be played by both children and adults.  This is achieved through customisation options that allow the parameters of the game to be changed by the player and includes separate colour themes for children and adults.

The children's theme is the default because the author wanted the least amount of friction to children playing and enjoying the game.

## Scope


## Design


### Colour Scheme
I have chosen the ability to select from two colour schemes for the game.  One is a more somber less garish colour pallet targeted at adults.  The other is a more bright a colourful pallet that should appeal more to children.  

The reason for this is that I wanted the game to be accessibly to people of all ages; a game parents could let their children play to improve their maths skills and a game that adults can play to improve their day to day mental arithmatic. 

Just having the one child-like colour pallet could put off adult players.

### Typography
I chose the short stack font for it's readable quality and because it reflects characters that are rendered in a more hand written way than traditional typography.  This should make it more readable and accessible for children.

I chose Schoolbell because it has a more childlike, handwriten quality but is less readable.  As such it's use has been limited to in-game pop up messages such as, correct, try again and you won.

I chose the "Press Start 2P" font for the high scores page because it has an 8 bit retro feel.  I wanted to recreate an arcade style high score page and this fits perfectly.

For the adult theme I have chosen to use the Ariel font throughout to keep the theme more serious looking.

All fonts are served from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

No images have been used in the creation of the game.
